import Demo from "../components/ConcurrencyDemo";

When defining a task, a configuration object that can accept the following parameters:

## Keep

The `keep` property defines whether task instances should be aborted based on another performace of the task.

```js
const [perform] = useTask(
  function*() {
    // ...
  },
  { keep: "last" }
);
```

### `last` (default)

Only the last instance of a task will be kept; if the task is performed again while another instance of it is running, the previous instance will be aborted.

<Demo keep="last" />

### `first`

If the task is performed again while another instance is running, the new instance will be aborted instantly and the previous instance kept running.

<Demo keep="first" />

### `all`

All instances of a task will be kept; a task instance will never be aborted based on performing the task again.

<Demo keep="all" />
