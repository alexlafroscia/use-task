title: Installation
---

You can install `useTask` through NPM by adding it to your dependencies:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add use-task

# Using NPM
npm install --save use-task
```

## Global Dependency: `AbortController`

Internally, `useTask` makes use of the [`AbortController`][abort-controller] API that was introduced as part of the effort to create a means for cancelling `fetch`. It should work in all evergreen browsers, but if that does not fit your use case, you can find information on polyfilling it [here][abort-controller-polyfill].
