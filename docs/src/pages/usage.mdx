title: Usage
---

A **Task** represents a series of asynchronous steps that you want to take, one after another. If the component defining the task is unmounted while the task is running, the task will be aborted.

A task is defined using a [Generator][generator] function. You can think of it a lot like `async/await`, but instead of using `await` with each promise, you use `yield`.

Because it is built using a Generator, the task can choose to stop running the function at any `yield`. This allows us to abort a running task, meaning that nothing past the last `yield` will be executed.

A task can be aborted:

1. When the component that defined it is unmounted
2. Based on the `keep` configuration of the task
3. Manually using `AbortController`

```jsx
import useTask, { timeout } from "use-task";

function MySearchComponent() {
  const [performSearch, searchState] = useTask(function*(term) {
    yield timeout(150); // Debounce while user is typing

    const result = yield fetch(`https://search.api.com?term=${term}`);
    const searchResults = yield result.json();

    return searchResults;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        onInput={event => {
          perform(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      {searchState.lastSuccessful && (
        <ul>
          {results.map(result => (
            <li>{result}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
